# Forge simulation spike - findings (2026-08-15)

Goal: can we use [Forge](https://github.com/Card-Forge/forge) as the
fitness oracle for simulation-driven deck improvement?

**Verdict: yes.** All numbers from this container (4 CPUs, Java 21).

## Setup that works

1. Download `forge-installer-<ver>.jar` from the GitHub release, install
   headlessly (IzPack console mode):
   `printf '\n1\n<target-dir>\n1\nO\n1\n1\n1\n' | java -jar forge-installer-X.jar -console`
2. **Xvfb is required** - Forge's desktop jar initializes the GUI toolkit
   even in sim mode and dies *silently* (exceptions go to sentry, exit 1,
   nothing on stderr) without a display. `xvfb-run -a java ...` fixes it.
3. Decks: plain `.dck` files (`[metadata]/Name=`, `[Main]`, `qty name`
   lines) placed in `~/.forge/decks/constructed/`. Our corpus decks
   convert trivially. (The `-D <dir>` flag did not pick up decks in
   2.0.14; the constructed dir does.)
4. Run:
   ```
   xvfb-run -a java -Xmx4096m -Dio.netty.tryReflectionSetAccessible=true \
     -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -jar forge-gui-desktop-<ver>-jar-with-dependencies.jar \
     sim -d deckA.dck deckB.dck -n 20 -q
   ```
   `-q` = one result line per game plus running match score.
   Full syntax (recovered from SimulateMatch constant pool): also
   `-t` tournaments (Bracket/RoundRobin/Swiss), `-f` format,
   `-a` AI profile per player, `-S` RNG seed.

## Numbers

- **Throughput**: 20 games in 58 s wall incl. ~6 s startup -> ~2.6 s/game
  per process; a process uses ~1.6 cores, so 2 parallel processes on
  4 CPUs -> roughly **2,500-3,500 games/hour** on this box.
- Startup is ~6 s per invocation - batch many games per invocation
  (`-n` large) rather than one game per process.
- **Seeding caveat**: `-S` exists but does NOT fully determinize a match:
  with the same seed, game 1 reproduced but later games diverged
  (thread-timing-dependent RNG use). Common-random-numbers variance
  reduction is therefore unreliable; budget for racing / larger N
  instead.
- Corpus decks (MTGO pauper burn, stompy) loaded with no unsupported
  cards; occasional AI warnings in logs (e.g. an activator hiccup on
  Sneaky Snacker) but games complete.
- Sanity: stompy beat burn 16-4 over 20 - direction plausible (Forge AI
  is known to pilot creature aggro better than precise burn math).

## Implications for the improve-loop design

- A candidate-swap evaluation at ~200 games costs ~4-6 min of box time;
  a full improvement run (20 candidates, racing down to finalists,
  ~5-10k games) is a 1.5-3 h offline job. Overnight product shape
  confirmed.
- Gauntlet decks come straight from `data/decks/mtgo-decks.jsonl.gz`.
- Proposal step must filter to Forge-playable cards; detection = dry-run
  deck load and grep for load warnings.
